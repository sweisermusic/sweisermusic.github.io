I feel like I could have done a much better job with this project with
more time, and I know that spending the time to make this website more
presentable is very important to me when I have more free time. However,
for now, I am glad to know that I understand the basic rules of HTML and CSS
coding.
I found looking at websites from other students to be an especially good
resource when I was stuck.
